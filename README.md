# Meet-n-Compete

My final 4-person group Senior Project that I worked on and was the team lead for from January 2020 - June 2020

--Brief Overview--

As many people have experienced, finding people to organize pick-up
games with can be difficult. Often a person will head over to a local park just to
find out that the park is already being used, there arenâ€™t enough people, or the
people that are there are all different ages. As founders of Meet-N-Compete, our
number 1 goal was to find a solution to these problems by applying our
programming skills to provide an online means for people to Organize, Create, &
Join pick-up games, thereby making it easier for people to get out there and
compete in their favorite sports.

In short, Meet-N-Compete is a built-from-scratch dynamic website where
people can organize pick-up games and events for 18 different sports at local
parks around their area. We successfully implemented most of what we had
originally planned, including some extra features we envisioned along the way.
There were also a few features we were not able to get to, or would like to have
expanded on, however, time did not permit us to do so. Overall, we as a team are
very proud and satisfied with what we were able to accomplish and learn while
working on this project over these last two quarters.
